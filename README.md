# Projet-Transverse
Welcome to Just a Plumber ! The new platformer game by the Aladdi Team composed by Julien Le Ber, Mathieu Roche, Tromparent Edgar and Soudani Fares.
Just a Plumber is a basic platformer where a Sorcerer has to go from a point A to a point B.
In order to create the game we used Pygame and in order to create the graphism we used Tiled.
We also implemented a music to create a jungle atmosphere.
<!>Be careful, before launching the game, you need to :
  -Installed Tiled
  -Import every asset (in the folder "Tileset" of the project) to the map.
  -Hit CTRL + S
And thats it.
Hope you'll Like it !
